      <p>
        Hieronymus Bosch was a Dutch painter and draftsman active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. He is known for his highly imaginative and fantastical works, many of which depict religious themes and moral lessons. Bosch's paintings are characterized by their use of symbolism and their intricate, often surreal imagery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bosch's influence can be seen in the works of many later artists, particularly those of the Surrealist movement in the 20th century. His use of symbolism and surreal imagery has been compared to that of Salvador Dal√≠, and his influence on the development of modern art is widely acknowledged. In addition to his paintings, Bosch also created drawings and prints, many of which were used as illustrations in religious texts. Despite the fact that he was active several centuries ago, Bosch's work continues to be exhibited in museums and galleries around the world.

        Hieronymus Bosch, also known as Jheronimus Bosch, was a Dutch painter and draughtsman who lived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. He was born in the city of 's-Hertogenbosch, which is located in the Netherlands. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he was born into a family of painters and may have trained with his father.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bosch's early works were primarily religious in nature, with themes of morality and sin often being depicted in his paintings. He was a member of the religious Brotherhood of Our Lady, which may have influenced his choice of subject matter. His earliest surviving painting, "The Adoration of the Magi," dates back to 1485 and shows a clear influence of the International Gothic style.

        Hieronymus Bosch was a devout Christian and his religious beliefs heavily influenced his art. He was a member of the religious Brotherhood of Our Lady, a lay fraternity that was active in his hometown of 's-Hertogenbosch. The group's main focus was on devotion to the Virgin Mary and the promotion of piety among its members. It is believed that Bosch's membership in this group played a role in his choice of subject matter for his paintings, as many of his works depict religious themes such as morality and sin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bosch's work often shows a deep understanding of Christian theology and iconography, depicting a wide range of religious themes, including the Last Judgment, heaven, and hell. He also depicted the lives of saints and scenes from the Bible, such as the Temptation of Christ. His works often feature fantastical and grotesque imagery, which has led some scholars to interpret them as moralizing allegories meant to instruct viewers on the dangers of sin and the importance of leading a virtuous life.

        One of Hieronymus Bosch's most famous artworks is "The Garden of Earthly Delights," a triptych painting that is currently housed in the Prado Museum in Madrid, Spain. The painting is a complex and detailed depiction of the creation, the fall of man, and the last judgment. The outer wings of the triptych depict God creating the world, while the central panel, which is the largest, depicts a fantastical and chaotic scene of people indulging in a wide range of sins and pleasures. The right wing of the triptych shows the last judgment, with damned souls being punished for their sins. The painting is considered a masterpiece of early Netherlandish art and is widely studied and admired for its intricate details and symbolism.

        Another famous artwork by Bosch is "The Haywain Triptych," which is also housed in the Prado Museum. This triptych painting depicts a large hay cart in the central panel, surrounded by a wide range of figures, both human and animal. The left wing of the triptych shows the temptation of Christ in the desert, while the right wing shows the final judgment. The painting is known for its rich symbolism, with the hay cart often being interpreted as a metaphor for the fleeting nature of human life and worldly pursuits.

        Hieronymus Bosch's later works were less religious in nature and often depicted scenes of everyday life. He was commissioned to paint a number of altarpieces for churches in the Netherlands, including the Church of St. John in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Church of St. Peter in 's-Hertogenbosch, and the Church of St. John the Baptist in 's-Hertogenbosch. He also painted a number of portraits, including a portrait of his wife, Maria van den Bosch, and a portrait of his son, Jheronimus van Aken.
